## Fill in Identities within a set of Clips

Standard video and movie description tasks **abstract away from person identitie**s, thus failing to link identities across sentences. We propose a multi-sentence Identity-Aware Video Description task, which overcomes this limitation and requires to **re-identify persons locally within a set of consecutive clips**. We introduce an auxiliary task of **Fill-in the Identity**, that aims to predict persons' IDs consistently within a set of clips, when the video descriptions are given.
